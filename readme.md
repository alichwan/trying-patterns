# Render patterns

The idea is to play with some page render patterns. Each one of this will be in it's own folder for practical purposes.

Patterns:

- [Single static website](#single-static-website) [ToDo]
- [Multi-page app](#multi-page-app) [ToDo]
- [Single page app](#single-page-app) [ToDo]
- [Server-side rendering](#server-side-rendering) [ToDo]
